# Hangman
Welcome to the Hangman game demo

## Prerequisites
You will need to have node in your machine, you can install node via:- https://nodejs.org/en/

- Once you have node installed in your system, try to test it through running npm (the node package manager)

## How to run 
1.) cd hangman && npm i (will install all the required dependencies from package.json)

2.) That's it, once you have all the dependency installed you can straight away do ```npm start``` and you would see a console interactive interface

Have fun :)
